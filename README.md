# Flutter iBudget App

This is the back-end part of my personal full-stack project named iBudget app. This backend is developed in **Node JS**, using **Typescript**.

This app is intended for people who need to manage their personal finances on a weekly/monthly basis. Users can:

- Create and manage their monthly budgets
- Add and manage transactions (income and expenses)
- See a summary of their net movements
- Create multiple accounts (debit and credit)
- See the report in multiple currencies

Front-end of the project can be found here [iBudget Front-end](https://github.com/SebasAriasDEV/Expenses-App-Frontend).


## Technologies used in Back-End

- Node JS (Runtime)
- Express (Server)
- Mongo DB/Mongoose (Database)
